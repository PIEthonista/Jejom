The story is set in a small, isolated village nestled in the mountains of Jeju Island. The village is steeped in tradition and superstition, with a rich history of myths and legends that have been passed down through generations. The villagers believe in the existence of powerful spirits and gods that inhabit the mountains and forests, and they live in fear of their wrath.

The story revolves around four key characters: Soo-jin, a young and ambitious detective from the city who is sent to the village to investigate a series of mysterious murders; Joon-ho, a local farmer who becomes a prime suspect in the case; Eun-hee, a shaman who claims to have visions of the future and may hold the key to solving the murders; and Dong-hyun, a mysterious stranger who has recently arrived in the village and seems to know more about the murders than he lets on.

Soo-jin arrives in the village with a sense of determination and purpose, but she soon finds herself confronted by the villagers' deep-rooted superstitions and their reluctance to cooperate with her investigation. She begins to suspect that the murders may be connected to the village's dark history and the myths and legends that have shaped its culture.

As Soo-jin delves deeper into the case, she uncovers a series of clues that lead her to Joon-ho, who becomes her prime suspect. Joon-ho is a quiet and reserved man who has lived in the village all his life, and he seems to know more about the myths and legends than he lets on. Soo-jin begins to suspect that Joon-ho may be using his knowledge of the supernatural to commit the murders, but she can't find any concrete evidence to prove it.

Eun-hee, the village shaman, becomes an important figure in the investigation when she claims to have visions of the murders. She tells Soo-jin that the murders are the work of a powerful spirit that has been awakened by the actions of a human being. Eun-hee believes that the only way to stop the murders is to appease the spirit and perform a ritual to send it back to the afterlife.

Dong-hyun, the mysterious stranger, adds another layer of complexity to the case. He seems to know more about the murders than he lets on, and he becomes a suspect in Soo-jin's investigation. However, as Soo-jin gets to know him, she begins to suspect that he may be the key to solving the case. Dong-hyun has a deep understanding of the village's history and myths, and he seems to have a personal connection to the spirit that is causing the murders.

As the investigation unfolds, Soo-jin must navigate the village's complex web of superstition, suspicion, and fear. She must confront her own beliefs about the supernatural and come to terms with the possibility that the murders may be the work of a powerful spirit. In the end, she must make a difficult decision that will determine the fate of the village and the lives of its inhabitants.
