The background setting for the murder mystery is the ancient city of Seongsan, located on Jeju Island, Korea. The crime scene is set in a traditional Jeju house, known as a "Gasok," which is nestled amidst the lush greenery of the island. The house belongs to the wealthy and influential Lee family, who are known for their deep roots in the local community and their involvement in various aspects of Jeju's history and culture.

The storyline revolves around four key characters:

1. Detective Kim, an experienced investigator from the Jeju Police Department, who is assigned to solve the case. He is well-versed in the local legends, myths, history, and culture, which he uses to unravel the mystery.
2. Eun-hee, the daughter of the Lee family, who is found dead in her bedroom. She was a talented artist, known for her depictions of Jeju's natural beauty and mythological creatures.
3. Tae-joon, Eun-hee's fianc√©, who is a successful businessman. He is a proud descendant of the legendary Jeju warrior, Tae-joon the Great, and is deeply involved in the local community, particularly in preserving Jeju's cultural heritage.
4. Soo-jin, Eun-hee's best friend and a local historian. She is a scholar of Jeju's myths and legends, and her expertise in the island's history and culture proves invaluable to Detective Kim's investigation.

The course of the case begins with the discovery of Eun-hee's body in her bedroom. The room is adorned with her paintings, which depict various mythological creatures and scenes from Jeju's history. The murder scene is staged to resemble a scene from the legend of the "Halla Mountain Spirit," a powerful deity that is said to protect Jeju Island.

As Detective Kim delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a complex web of secrets and lies that connect the four main characters. Tae-joon, who was supposed to marry Eun-hee in a few days, becomes the prime suspect. However, Soo-jin's research into Jeju's history and culture reveals a shocking truth: the murder is not just a simple act of passion or greed, but a ritual sacrifice to appease the wrath of the "Halla Mountain Spirit."

The key events in the story include:

1. The discovery of Eun-hee's body in her bedroom, which is staged to resemble a scene from the "Halla Mountain Spirit" legend.
2. The interrogation of Tae-joon, who becomes the prime suspect in the case.
3. Soo-jin's revelation about the ritual sacrifice and its connection to the "Halla Mountain Spirit."
