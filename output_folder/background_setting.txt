The murder mystery unfolds in the ancient city of Seongju, located on the outskirts of Jeju Island. This city, once a thriving hub of trade and culture, has fallen into decay, its grand palaces and temples now reclaimed by the surrounding jungle. The city's history is steeped in the legends of the island's guardian spirits, the Dokkaebi, and the mythical sea serpent, the Yeouija.

The story begins with the discovery of a murdered body in the heart of the city, near the ruins of the ancient royal palace. The victim, a wealthy merchant named Lee, was known for his ruthless business practices and exploitation of the island's resources. His body is found with a dagger plunged into his heart, adorned with intricate carvings of the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija.

The four key characters are:

1. Detective Kim, a seasoned investigator with a deep understanding of Jeju Island's culture and mythology.
2. Soo, a local historian and archaeologist who holds the key to the city's hidden secrets.
3. Hye-won, a young woman with a mysterious past, connected to the island's guardian spirits.
4. Joon, a former soldier turned bodyguard, tasked with protecting Hye-won from the dangerous forces that seek to exploit her powers.

Detective Kim is called to the scene of the crime and immediately senses that this is no ordinary murder. The intricate carvings on the dagger suggest a deep understanding of Jeju Island's mythology, and the victim's past makes it difficult to determine who could have committed such a heinous act.

As Detective Kim delves deeper into the investigation, he enlists the help of Soo, who provides valuable insights into the city's history and the legends of the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija. Together, they uncover a series of clues that lead them to Hye-won, a woman with a mysterious connection to the island's guardian spirits.

Hye-won's powers have attracted the attention of a powerful criminal organization, led by a man known only as the Serpent. The organization seeks to harness Hye-won's powers to control the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija, using them to gain control over the island's resources and its people.

As Detective Kim and Soo race to solve the murder and protect Hye-won, they are aided by Joon, who has sworn to protect her from the dangerous forces that seek to exploit her powers. Together, the four characters must navigate a web of secrets, betrayal, and danger as they unravel the truth behind the murder and the dark forces that threaten Jeju Island.

The story culminates in a thrilling confrontation with the Serpent and his organization, as the four characters must use their unique skills and knowledge to defeat the forces of evil and restore peace to the island. Along the way, they uncover the true nature of the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija, and the crucial role they play in the balance of power on Jeju Island.

In the end, the murder mystery is solved, and the four characters are forever changed by their experiences. The city of Seongju, once a symbol of decay and despair, is reborn as a beacon of hope and unity, its people united in their commitment to protect the island's rich cultural heritage and its mythical guardians.
