This city, once a thriving hub of trade and culture, has fallen into decay, its grand palaces and temples now reclaimed by the surrounding jungle. The city's history is steeped in the legends of the island's guardian spirits, the Dokkaebi, and the mythical sea serpent, the Yeouija.\n\nThe story begins with the discovery of a murdered body in the heart of the city, near the ruins of the ancient royal palace. The victim, a wealthy merchant named Lee, was known for his ruthless business practices and exploitation of the island's resources. His body is found with a dagger plunged into his heart, adorned with intricate carvings of the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija.\n\nThe four key characters are:\n\n1. Detective Kim, a seasoned investigator with a deep understanding of Jeju Island's culture and mythology.\n2.

Joon, a former soldier turned bodyguard, tasked with protecting Hye-won from the dangerous forces that seek to exploit her powers.\n\nDetective Kim is called to the scene of the crime and immediately senses that this is no ordinary murder.

Together, they uncover a series of clues that lead them to Hye-won, a woman with a mysterious connection to the island's guardian spirits.\n\nHye-won's powers have attracted the attention of a powerful criminal organization, led by a man known only as the Serpent. The organization seeks to harness Hye-won's powers to control the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija, using them to gain control over the island's resources and its people.\n\nAs Detective Kim and Soo race to solve the murder and protect Hye-won, they are aided by Joon, who has sworn to protect her from the dangerous forces that seek to exploit her powers. Together, the four characters must navigate a web of secrets, betrayal, and danger as they unravel the truth behind the murder and the dark forces that threaten Jeju Island.\n\nThe story culminates in a thrilling confrontation with the Serpent and his organization, as the four characters must use their unique skills and knowledge to defeat the forces of evil and restore peace to the island. Along the way, they uncover the true nature of the Dokkaebi and the Yeouija, and the crucial role they play in the balance of power on Jeju Island.\n\nIn the end, the murder mystery is solved, and the four characters are forever changed by their experiences.
