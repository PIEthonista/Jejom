Detective Kim:

Day 1 (4 days before the crime):

Detective Kim woke up early and headed to the Jeju Police Department for a briefing on a new case. He was assigned to investigate a series of thefts targeting artifacts from Jeju's cultural heritage sites. Kim was determined to solve the case and preserve Jeju's cultural heritage.

Day 2:

Kim met with Soo-jin, a local historian, to gather information about the stolen artifacts. They discussed the significance of the artifacts and the potential impact on Jeju's cultural heritage. Kim also confessed his secret crush on Soo-jin, but she didn't seem to reciprocate his feelings.

Day 3:

Kim received a call from Eun-hee's father, who asked for his help in finding his missing daughter. Eun-hee was last seen at the Seongsan Ilchulbong, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where she was working on a painting. Kim agreed to investigate the case and promised to find Eun-hee.

Day 4 (Crime Day):

Kim arrived at the Seongsan Ilchulbong and found Eun-hee's body at the base of the cliff. He immediately suspected foul play and began investigating the scene. Kim noticed a strange symbol carved into the rock near Eun-hee's body and took a photo of it.

Kim concluded that the crime was not a random act of violence, but a carefully planned murder. He suspected that the "Guardians of Jeju" may be involved in the ritual sacrifice of Eun-hee to preserve Jeju's cultural heritage.
