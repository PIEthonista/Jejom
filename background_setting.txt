Background Setting:

The story unfolds in the late 19th century, during the Joseon Dynasty, when Jeju Island was known as a place of exile and isolation. The island's unique cultural and historical context, influenced by the mythical status of Jeju women, the influence of animism, and the island's geographical features, provides a rich backdrop for the murder mystery.

Crime Scene Setting:

The crime scene is set in the Seongeomdang Palace, a historical residence on Jeju Island that was once the seat of power for the local governors. The palace, with its intricate architecture and lush gardens, is a symbol of the island's rich history and the power dynamics at play.

Course of the Case:

The story revolves around four key characters:

1. Yoon, a skilled detective from the mainland, who is called to Jeju Island to investigate the mysterious death of the island's governor.
2. Hae-won, the governor's wife, a powerful and enigmatic figure who is rumored to possess healing powers, drawing from the mythical status of Jeju women.
3. In-ho, the governor's advisor, who is both a confidant and a rival to Hae-won, and is deeply involved in the island's political intrigues.
4. Seong-hee, a young and ambitious artist from the mainland, who has been commissioned to paint a portrait of Hae-won, and becomes entangled in the mystery.

Key Event Descriptions:

1. The Mysterious Death: The governor is found dead in his study, with no apparent cause of death. Yoon arrives on the island to investigate, and soon discovers that the governor's death may not have been natural.
2. The Healing Ceremony: Hae-won, in an attempt to protect her husband's legacy and maintain her own power, organizes a healing ceremony, drawing on the animistic beliefs of the island. Yoon, skeptical of the ceremony's authenticity, begins to suspect that Hae-won may be involved in the governor's death.
3. The Political Intrigue: As Yoon delves deeper into the investigation, he uncovers a complex web of political intrigue involving In-ho, who is revealed to be plotting against Hae-won to seize control of the island.
4. The Artist's Discovery: Seong-hee, while working on Hae-won's portrait, discovers a hidden message that leads her to believe that the governor's death was not an accident. She shares this information with Yoon, who realizes that the key to solving the mystery lies in the island's cultural and historical context.
