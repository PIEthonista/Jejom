The murder mystery is set in the bustling city of Seoul, Korea, during the late 1940s. The story unfolds against the backdrop of the Korean War, a period of great turmoil and unrest in the country. The city is in a state of chaos, with the constant threat of bombings and the struggle for survival looming over its inhabitants.

The crime scene is a grand, traditional Korean house called a hanok, located in the heart of Seoul. The house, known as the "House of Whispers," was once a thriving cultural center, where locals and travelers alike gathered to share stories, poetry, and music. However, in recent years, the house has fallen into disrepair, and its once lively atmosphere has been replaced by an eerie silence.

The story revolves around four key characters:

1. Jin-hee, a young woman who inherited the House of Whispers from her late grandmother. She is determined to restore the house to its former glory and revive the cultural traditions that once thrived there.

2. Seong-ho, a talented musician and storyteller who was a close friend of Jin-hee's grandmother. He is a beloved figure in the community, known for his captivating performances and deep understanding of Jeju Island's legends and myths.

3. Eun-ju, a mysterious woman who arrives in Seoul seeking refuge from the war. She is a skilled healer and herbalist, with a deep connection to the natural world and the spirits that inhabit it.

4. Joon-ho, a detective with the Seoul Police Department, assigned to investigate the murder that takes place at the House of Whispers. He is a determined and resourceful investigator, driven by a desire to bring justice to the victim and bring peace to the troubled city.

The course of the case begins when Jin-hee discovers the body of Seong-ho, brutally murdered in the House of Whispers. As Joon-ho delves into the investigation, he uncovers a web of secrets and lies that connect the four characters. Eun-ju's arrival in Seoul is revealed to be connected to a centuries-old curse believed to be linked to the House of Whispers, and Jin-hee's determination to restore the house may be putting her in grave danger.

As the investigation progresses, the characters must confront the darker aspects of Jeju Island's myths and legends, including the existence of powerful spirits and the consequences of disturbing the balance between the natural and supernatural worlds. The story culminates in a dramatic confrontation, where the characters must make a stand against the forces that threaten to consume them and the city of Seoul.

Throughout the story, the characters are influenced by the rich cultural heritage of Jeju Island, as they grapple with the consequences of their actions and the challenges of their environment. The House of Whispers serves as a symbol of the struggle between tradition and modernity, as the characters navigate the complexities of their relationships and the dark secrets that lie beneath the surface of their world.
