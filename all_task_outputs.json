The crime scene is a grand mansion, once the residence of a wealthy businessman with roots on Jeju Island. The mansion, now abandoned, is a testament to the opulence and extravagance of its former owner, who amassed his fortune through shady deals and illicit activities.\n\nThe story revolves around four key characters:\n\n1. Detective Lee, a tenacious and resourceful investigator with a deep-seated connection to Jeju Island. Her grandmother, a renowned storyteller, often regaled her with tales of the island's myths and legends, instilling in her a sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth.\n\n2. Heo, the wealthy businessman's estranged son, who returns to the mansion after years of absence. Heo is haunted by the ghosts of his past, including the memory of his mother, who was rumored to be a powerful shaman with ties to Jeju Island's spiritual world.\n\n3. Yoon, a local journalist with a keen interest in the island's history and culture. Yoon is determined to uncover the truth behind the murder, believing it to be connected to a centuries-old curse that has plagued the family for generations.\n\n4. Park, a former employee of the businessman, who holds a deep-seated grudge against him. Park knows the dark secrets of the family and is willing to do whatever it takes to see justice served.\n\nThe course of the case is fraught with danger and intrigue, as the characters navigate the complex web of secrets and lies that surround the murder. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they uncover a series of key events that shed light on the family's past and the curse that has haunted them for generations.\n\nOne such event is the tragic love story of the businessman's grandparents, who were separated by the turbulent history of Jeju Island. Their unfulfilled love is believed to be the source of the curse that has plagued the family, and it is this curse that drives the characters to uncover the truth.\n\nAnother key event is the mysterious disappearance of the businessman's wife, who was rumored to be a powerful shaman with ties to Jeju Island's spiritual world. Her disappearance is believed to be connected to the curse, and the characters must unravel the mystery of her fate to solve the case.\n\nAs the investigation progresses, the characters must confront their own demons and come to terms with the legacy of Jeju Island's history and culture. In the end, the truth is revealed, and the characters are forced to confront the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe murder mystery is a testament to the enduring power of Jeju Island's legends, history, and culture, and the influence they have on the lives of those who are connected to them. The story is a gripping tale of love, betrayal, and redemption, set against the backdrop of a rich and atmospheric world that draws players in and keeps them engaged until the very end.",
